Back then, the only motivator that I had was pleasure.</p>\n<p>Right now, it's far more commercialized.

For Jazelle's post:</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:share:7191913594995777536\" height=\"753\" width=\"504\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"Embedded post\">\n</iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.namisunami.com/%22https:/www.linkedin.com/in/jazellemaira-design/%22\">Jazelle</a> and I are both learning to code. Her part more focused on frontend, and mine on full-stack framework (currently Redwood.js).</p>\n<p>But, finding time for coding is not easy. During the day, I have work. And after some days, I ran out of energy or time to work on my learning.</p>\n<p>So, we started a new routine: co-coding time on Saturdays. After grocery shopping in the morning, we go to the library, get coffee, and find a spot to sit together and work on our respective learning projects.</p>\n<p>Spending time together for things that we like is nice. Of course, we can learn things independently in our own time. But, I think there's a power to sharing the same moment together, even though we are not interacting with each other.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it's a social facilitation effect in action.</p>\n<p>And that is one way I wrote my dissertation—through a writing time. But, that's a topic for another post.</p>\n<p>Be it couples, friends, or colleagues—coding together can be fun and fulfilling. We are social being after all.</p>\n",
