I took one week off from work. Thanks to the collective labor agreement, I get a good number of off days.

The last day of vacation is a bittersweet. It's bitter because it's the end of fun, and I need to get back to work. It's sweet because I got to get back to work with exciting groups of people.

When I was growing up, I did not do well on the last days of vacation. When in school, I had a lot of homework during the summer vacation. I always procrastinated, and did it at the last-minute. One summer in high school, I was unable to do so. Looking back, that led me to quit high school.

So, I think about the end of vacation with those painful memories. And a sense of regretâ€“that I should have done something else, spent time something better.

But I also know that these thoughts can be irrational. Who decides whether the person spent a good holiday or not? Most likely, the decision is with the self: with me.

So, I say to myself, I had a great day off. I spent my time best for myself. And I'm excited to begin giving back to the world.

No one can give what they don't have, after all.
