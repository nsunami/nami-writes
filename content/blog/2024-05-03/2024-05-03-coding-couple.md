I posted on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nsunami_github-jazellemairamidi-piano-midi-activity-7192512511823208448-f6rO?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) about Jazelle and my coding time on Saturdays. For Jazelle's post:

[Jazelle]("https://www.linkedin.com/in/jazellemaira-design/") and I are both learning to code. Her part more focused on frontend, and mine on full-stack framework (currently Redwood.js).

But, finding time for coding is not easy. During the day, I have work. And after some days, I ran out of energy or time to work on my learning.

So, we started a new routine: co-coding time on Saturdays. After grocery shopping in the morning, we go to the library, get coffee, and find a spot to sit together and work on our respective learning projects.

Spending time together for things that we like is nice. Of course, we can learn things independently in our own time. But, I think there's a power to sharing the same moment together, even though we are not interacting with each other.

Perhaps it's a social facilitation effect in action.

And that is one way I wrote my dissertation—through a writing time. But, that's a topic for another post.

Be it couples, friends, or colleagues—coding together can be fun and fulfilling. We are social being after all.
