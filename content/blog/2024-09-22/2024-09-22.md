I'm trying to (re)start my blog [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/).

The first time I wrote a blog was probably in my early teen, and it was in Japanese.

A lot has changed since thenâ€”not only my age, but also the online world.

I felt special writing something into the online space, sharing part of myself. Back then, the only motivator that I had was pleasure.

Right now, it's far more commercialized. For many people, writing online is a job, not a pleasure.

Will I find my pleasure writing again? I'm not sure, but I'm open to trying.
