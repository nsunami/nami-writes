I bought domains at GoDaddy a long time ago, but I realized that I'm overpaying too much. I decided that GoDaddy is not for me, not only because the name is too masculine, but also that it has services that I don't use.

My current bill with GoDaddy is as follows  (with taxes and fees):

- namisunami.com: $26.83
- naoyukisunami.com: $22.17

After switching to Cloudflare, they will be as follows:

- namisunami.com: $10.44
- naoyukisunami.com: $10.44

I will be cutting my domain bills by more than half, which is great.
