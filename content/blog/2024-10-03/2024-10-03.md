Netlify has been great. But I don't want to depend on that too much. Currently, you can use [300 minutes Netlify goodness](https://web.archive.org/web/20240929174122/https://www.netlify.com/pricing/) for free. After that, it will cost a whopping $19 per month to use the platform. No, thank you. Instead, I set up Coolify and a GitHub action to accomplish the same benefits.

## What is Netlify Anyway? (for me)

I used Netlify for the following benefits:

1. Deploying my website. Netlify can build a website for you and host it there. You can manage a domain name.

2. Deployment previews for pull requests: When I open a pull request on GitHub, I want to preview the app. Netlify can create a preview for you and comment on that pull request with a pretty message:

## Why I want to move away from Netlify

SaaS like Netlify can change their mind anytime. In 2018, users used to get [100 hours of run time](https://web.archive.org/web/20180402165424/https://www.netlify.com/pricing/). In 2024, it's down to 6 hours. Maybe in the future, we will get none---who knows.

I want to avoid being at Netlify's mercy; that's why I set up to accomplish the same benefits, using a different way.

## Coolify & GitHub Action

I have a virtual private server (VPS) running on [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/), and there I run my Coolify instance. Coolify is an open-source Netlify replacement in a nutshell. I like it because it gives me things to click around on via the GUI.

On Coolify, I can deploy websites, including this one. So, I can take care of the Benefit No. 1 about deploying by using Coolify.

To accomplish Benefit No. 2 about deploy previews, I took two-step approach.

### Step 1: Coolify GitHub Integration

I connected Coolify with my GitHub repo ([Coolify > Integration](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/git/github/integration)). This integration does Preview Deployments: each Pull Request will trigger a new preview deployment.

But, this is not enoughâ€”I want a message on my Pull Request with a link to the Preview Deploy. To do so, I set up a GitHub action.

### Step 2: Pull Request Comment

I created a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/nsunami/nami-writes/blob/main/.github/workflows/pr-message.yml), which uses [Comment Pull Request Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/comment-pull-request).

Coolify uses a Pull Request number to produce a predictable Preview Deployments URL (e.g., pr100-blog.namisunami.com). So, I set up a message something like blow:

```yml
- message: |
Preview deployment available at https://pr{{"{{ github.event.number }}"}}-blog.namisunami.com
```

In Pull Request, the GitHub Actions bot will send a message:

{% image "gh-action-pr-message.jpg", "GitHub Action PR Message with a URL to the Preview Deployment", [500] %}

The message is not as pretty as Netlify's message, but it works for me to check the preview of the page before merging to the main.
